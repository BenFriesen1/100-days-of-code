## Day 1 - 
Code: HTML
<html> 
	<body>
		<main> the main is used to represent the main content of the body of the HTML document, it should be unique to the document and should not be repeated in other parts of the document.
Header : <h1> </h1> main biggest most important <h2> second most important <h3> third most important *EXAMPLE*       <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>       <h2>Cat Photos</h2> 
Comment : <!--     --> needs to be above the <P> element *EXAMPLE*     <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
Paragraph : <p>  *EXAMPLE*       <p>Everyone loves cute cats</p> 
all elements inside the <body> are called nested elements = they should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in (in this case the body)
image : <img> without a closing tag (void element)
HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behaviour.
source : <src> attributre in an <img> element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located)
image text : <alt> text is used for screen readers if image fails to load
<img src="link goes here.jpg" alt="text"> 
Link another page with the Anchor element : (a) <p> you can add words here <a href="link" target="_blank"> text </a> you can add words here </p> *EXAMPLE* <p>See more <a target="_blank" href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a> in our gallery.</p>
To open links in a new tab, you can use the Target attribte on the anchor (a) element :   â†‘target="_blank"
